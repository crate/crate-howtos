Connect to a Cluster
====================

To Connect to your Crate Cluster, you will need to know the IP or DNS address
of one node in the cluster and Crate uses port *4200* for HTTP transport. You
then have several options available, our :doc:`Admin UI <admin_ui>`, our
:doc:`CLI tool <crash>` (Crash) and a :doc:`REST API <../clients/rest/>`.
