Overview Bar and Tab
--------------------

At the top of the browser window is overview information about the cluster that
shows, from left to right:

- The name of the cluster, find out `how to change its value our configuration
  documentation
  <https://crate.io/docs/reference/configuration.html#cluster-name>`_

- The version of CrateDB that the cluster is running.

- The health of the data in the cluster. Green indicates that all data is
  replicated and available, yellow that there are unreplicated records and red
  that data is unavailable.

- Potential configuration problems and recommendations for the cluster.

- Average cluster load over the past 1, 5 and 15 minutes.

- Settings menu that allows you to update the language settings and provides a
  link to the CrateDB documentation and the latest CrateDB news.

The overview tab displays similar information to the bar but with more details
on data availability, cluster load and problems. On the left side of the window
there are five further tabs.
