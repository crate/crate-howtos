====================
The CrateDB HTTP API
====================

You can connect to the CrateDB HTTP endpoint with any standard tool, such as
`curl <http://curl.haxx.se/>`_ or `httpie <https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie>`_,
we will be using curl.

Connect to Crate
================

The endpoint expects a SQL statement sent as a value associated with the key
``stmt``, i.e.

.. code-block:: sh

    curl -sSXPOST 'CLUSTER_IP:4200/_sql?pretty' -d '{"stmt":"select name from sys.cluster"}'

Will connect to a cluster and return basic information about the cluster.
