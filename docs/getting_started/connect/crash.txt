======================
Crash, The CrateDB CLI
======================

Crash is CrateDB's shell for interacting with clusters.

The Crash shell can be used from within a node that is part of a cluster or on
another machine to connect to a remote cluster.

To launch Crash:

.. code-block:: sh

    ./bin/crash

Your command prompt will then switch to a ``cr>`` prompt. Connect to a cluster
using the URL and the CrateDB port (*4200*):

.. code-block:: sh

    cr> \connect 127.0.0.1:4200;

You can then use Crash to issue SQL queries and other commands.
