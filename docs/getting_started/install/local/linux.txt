========================
Install CrateDB on Linux
========================

Crate maintains official packages for Debian, RedHat Enterprise Linux and
Ubuntu. We recommend you use our 1-step installer that will configure the
appropriate package repository and install Crate for you.

.. code-block:: sh

    bash -c "$(curl -L install.crate.io)"

If you like to do things manually, here's how.

Debian
======

We provide Debian packages for the Wheezy (7.x) and Jessie (8.x) distributions.
To install CrateDB from our repository requires a couple of steps.

The first two steps are identical for both distributions.

1. Install HTTPS Support for Apt
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

2. Download and Install GPG Key
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

Debian Wheezy
-------------

3. Install Java 8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wheezy does not officially ship with Java 8, so you have to install it via a
3rd party repository, e.g. provided by **webupd8team**:

.. code-block:: sh

    echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

4. Add CrateDB Repository to Sources List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, add the CrateDB repository to */etc/apt/sources.list*.

Stable Releases
'''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: sh

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ wheezy main

Testing Releases
''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: sh

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ wheezy main

5. Fetch New Sources and Install CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

Verify that you have installed CrateDB and it's running:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo service crate status

Debian Jessie
-------------

3. Add Backports and CrateDB Repository to Sources List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, add the CrateDB repository to */etc/apt/sources.list*. Also add the
``jessie-backports`` repository to sources so that the Java 8 dependency can be
resolved automatically.

.. code-block:: sh

    deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main

Stable Releases
'''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: sh

    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ jessie main
    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ jessie main

Testing Releases
''''''''''''''''

.. code-block:: sh

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ jessie main

4. Fetch New Sources and Install CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate
    sudo systemctl enable crate

Verify that you have installed CrateDB and it's running:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo systemctl status crate

Red Hat
=======

The CrateDB Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based
releases, supporting Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 6,
CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6.

RHEL6
-----

Enable the CrateDB YUM Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All CrateDB packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must install
the public key and then install the *.rpm* containing the YUM repository
definition.

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/6/x86_64/crate-release-6.5-1.noarch.rpm

Testing and Unstable Releases
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The CrateDB Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development
builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from
testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change
during development, so you should disable it on production systems. If you want
to enable the Testing repo on your server, set ``enabled=1`` in
*/etc/yum.repos.d/crate.repo*.

Install CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    yum install crate

Start CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo service crate start

RHEL7
-----

The CrateDB Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based
releases. It's supported on Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux
7, CentOS 7, or Scientific Linux 7.

Enable the CrateDB YUM Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All CrateDB packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must install
the public key and then you can install the *.rpm* containing the YUM
repository definition.

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/7/noarch/crate-release-7.0-1.noarch.rpm

Install CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo yum install crate

Start CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo systemctl start crate.service

Ubuntu
======

We build packages for the Ubuntu versions Yakkety Yak (16.10), Xenial Xerus
(16.04), Trusty Tahr (14.04) and Precise Pangolin (12.04). They are available
on our `Launchpad page <https://launchpad.net/~crate>`_. Adding the repository
and installing CrateDB requires the following commands:

Install Java 8
--------------

Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 do not officially ship with Java 8, so you have to
`install it via a 3rd party repository
<https://crate.io/docs/install/local/linux/#debian-wheezy>`_

Install CrateDB
---------------

Adding a PPA repository requires ``python-software-properties`` to be
installed:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

Ubuntu >= **16.x** additionally requires ``software-properties-common``:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

Then it's possible to add the CrateDB repository using ``add-apt-repository``
and install CrateDB:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

Start CrateDB
-------------

CrateDB should have been started automatically by upstart and you can stop or
restart it with:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo service crate stop
    sudo service crate restart

Testing and Unstable Releases
-----------------------------

The CrateDB Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development
builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from
testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change
during development, so it should be disabled on production systems. If you want
to enable the Testing repo on your server. To enable the Testing Repository on
your machine add the PPA:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/testing
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

**Important:** CrateDB requires the latest Java 8 (at least u20 or higher). To
run CrateDB on Ubuntu releases older than 14.10 you would need to install Java
8 from the `Ubuntu Backports
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports>`_ repository.

Setting Environment Variables
=============================

On Ubuntu, Debian and RHEL systems the CrateDB startup script sources
environment variables, such as ``CRATE_HEAP_SIZE`` or ``CRATE_JAVA_OPTS`` that
you define in */etc/default/crate*.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: sh

    # Heap Size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max)
    CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

    # Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
    # MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

    # Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
    # bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
    # CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
    MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

    # Additional Java OPTS
    # CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

    # Force the JVM to use IPv4 stack
    CRATE_USE_IPV4=true
