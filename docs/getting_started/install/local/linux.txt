========================
Install CrateDB on Linux
========================

Crate maintains official packages for Debian, RedHat Enterprise Linux and
Ubuntu. We recommend you use our 1-step installer that will configure the
appropriate package repository and install Crate for you.

.. code-block:: sh

    bash -c "$(curl -L install.crate.io)"

If you like to do things manually, here's how.

Debian
======

We provide Debian packages for Wheezy (7.x), Jessie (8.x) and Stretch (9.x).
To install CrateDB from our repository requires a couple of steps.

The first three steps are identical for all distributions.

1. Install HTTPS Support for Apt
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

2. Download and Install GPG Key
-------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

3. Add APT repository to sources list
-------------------------------------

Next, add a file for the CrateDB repository in ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`` and
name it for example ``crate-testing.list`` (for testing repository) or
``crate-stable.list`` (for stable repository).

Add the following contents to the file and replace ``<codename>`` with the
actual codename of your distribution (``wheezy``, ``jessie``, or ``stretch``).

Stable Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ <codename> main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/stable/ <codename> main

Testing Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ <codename> main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/testing/ <codename> main

4. Additional Requirements
--------------------------

Debian Wheezy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wheezy does not officially ship with Java 8, so you have to install it via a
3rd party repository, e.g. provided by **webupd8team**:

.. code-block:: sh

    echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

Debian Jessie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jessie provides Java 8 via the backports repository. If you haven't added it
yet, you can do so by adding the following line to the
``/etc/apt/sources.list`` file:

.. code-block:: sh

    deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main

Debian Stretch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no additional requirements.

5. Fetch New Sources and Install CrateDB
----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

After the installation is finished, the ``crate`` service should be running.

Red Hat
=======

The CrateDB Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based
releases, supporting Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 6,
CentOS 6 and Scientific Linux 6.

RHEL6
-----

Enable the CrateDB YUM Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All CrateDB packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must install
the public key and then install the *.rpm* containing the YUM repository
definition.

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/6/x86_64/crate-release-6.5-1.noarch.rpm

Testing and Unstable Releases
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The CrateDB Testing repository is disabled by default, it contains development
builds and is frequently updated. The packages are waiting for feedback from
testers on functionality and stability. Packages in this repository will change
during development, so you should disable it on production systems. If you want
to enable the Testing repo on your server, set ``enabled=1`` in
*/etc/yum.repos.d/crate.repo*.

Install CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    yum install crate

Start CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo service crate start

RHEL7
-----

The CrateDB Team maintains the official YUM repositories for RPM-based
releases. It's supported on Linux Distributions such as RedHat Enterprise Linux
7, CentOS 7, or Scientific Linux 7.

Enable the CrateDB YUM Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All CrateDB packages are signed with GPG. To verify packages, you must install
the public key and then you can install the *.rpm* containing the YUM
repository definition.

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo rpm --import https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/RPM-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo rpm -Uvh https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/yum/7/noarch/crate-release-7.0-1.noarch.rpm

Install CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo yum install crate

Start CrateDB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo systemctl start crate.service

Ubuntu
======

We build packages for the Ubuntu versions Zesty Zapus (17.04), Yakkety Yak
(16.10), Xenial Xerus (16.04), and Trusty Tahr (14.04). CrateDB versions prior
to 2.1.0 are available on our `Launchpad page <https://launchpad.net/~crate>`_.
Adding the repository and installing CrateDB requires the following commands.

Notes on Java 8 on Ubuntu
-------------------------

CrateDB requires Java 8u20 or higher. To run Crate on Ubuntu releases older
than 14.10 you will need to install Java 8 manually. Ubuntu 14.04 does not
provide Java 8 in any of their official repos, so you have to `install it via a
3rd party repository
<https://crate.io/docs/install/local/linux/#debian-wheezy>`_

Install CrateDB From PPA
------------------------

.. NOTE::

   The Crate PPA on Launchpad is deprecated and only contains CrateDB versions
   prior to and including 2.0.x. Please read :ref:`install_from_deb_repo` for
   instructions how to install CrateDB >= 2.1.0 from our CrateDB Ubuntu
   repository.


Adding a PPA repository requires ``python-software-properties`` to be
installed:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

Ubuntu >= **16.x** additionally requires ``software-properties-common``:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

Then it's possible to add the CrateDB repository using ``add-apt-repository``
and install CrateDB:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/stable
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install crate

If you want to install testing releases, you can simply replace
``ppa:crate/stable`` with ``ppa:crate/testing`` and run ``apt-get update``
again.

.. _install_from_deb_repo:

Install CrateDB from DEB repository
-----------------------------------

.. NOTE::

   This repository contains only CrateDB versions greater than and equal to
   2.1.0.

First, you need to download and install the GPG key with which the packages are
verified.

.. code-block:: sh

    wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/deb/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate
    sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

Then add the testing or stable repo to your apt sources by adding a new file in
the ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`` directory with the following content:

.. code-block:: sh

    deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/deb/<repo>/ <codename> main
    deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/deb/<repo>/ <codename> main

Replace ``<repo>`` with ``testing`` or ``stable`` depending which repo you want
to use, and replace codename with the code name of your Ubuntu distribution.
Use ``source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME`` if you don't know the
code name of your distro.

Start CrateDB
-------------

CrateDB should have been started automatically. You can stop or restart the
``crate`` service with upstart or systemd.

.. code-block:: sh

    # with upstart/sysvinit
    sudo service crate stop
    sudo service crate restart
    # with systemd
    sudo systemctl stop crate
    sudo systemctl restart crate

Testing Releases
================

The CrateDB testing repositories contain releases that have not been declared
as stable. They are usually more frequently updated than the stable repos.
Packages in the testing repos are still waiting for feedback from testers on
functionality and stability, so they should not be used on production systems.

Setting Environment Variables
=============================

On Ubuntu, Debian and RHEL systems the CrateDB startup script sources
environment variables, such as ``CRATE_HEAP_SIZE`` or ``CRATE_JAVA_OPTS`` that
you define in */etc/default/crate*.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: sh

    # Heap Size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max)
    CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

    # Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
    # MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

    # Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
    # bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
    # CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
    MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

    # Additional Java OPTS
    # CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

    # Force the JVM to use IPv4 stack
    CRATE_USE_IPV4=true
