Run CrateDB on Packet
=====================

`Packet <https://www.packet.net>`_ is a bare metal provider built for the next
generation of production workloads. Their emphasis on API-centered cloud
deployment, fast networking, and container-ready hardware make them a good
choice for developers and production workloads - and perfect for CrateDB
clusters!

Create Your CrateDB Project
===========================

Packet organizes machines as projects which bundle together several types of
deployments:

- Servers
- Storage
- Network

To get started, create a new project called 'Crate' (or any name of your
choosing) and deploy some machines. For production use, we recommend `Type-1
<https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/>` servers, which are powerful enough to
handle medium to large workloads.

Start by choosing an operating system for your deployment. After the server is
ready, Packet's IaaS machines behave just like any other machine. Make sure to
deploy an SSH key to access the server and after the machines are ready, SSH
access can be obtained by logging in with ``ssh root@<public-ip>``. From there
it's just as any other Linux machine and there are several ways to install
CrateDB on the machine(s). Check out our guide :doc:`for installing CrateDB on
Linux. <../local/linux>`.
