CrateDB and JDBC
================

Compatibility
=============

To find out which drivers are compatible to your CrateDB version, please
consult the `reference documentation <https://crate.io/docs/reference/jdbc/>`_.

Add CrateDB to Your Project
===========================

A simple way to configure your project to connect to a CrateDB cluster is to
visit the JDBC driver page on `Bintray
<https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view>`_ and click the *Set Me Up*
button. This will give you a Maven or Gradle configuration that can be pasted
into your current project or downloaded for a new project.

For manual configuration follow these steps depending on your build system of
choice.

Maven
-----

Add the following to your *pom.xml* file:

.. code-block:: xml

    ...
    <repositories>
        ...
        <repository>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </snapshots>
            <id>central</id>
            <name>bintray</name>
            <url>http://dl.bintray.com/crate/crate</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    ...
    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.crate</groupId>
            <artifactId>crate-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>VERSION</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
    ...

Gradle
------

Add CrateDB as a dependency to your Gradle file:

.. code-block:: groovy

       repositories {
            ...
            jcenter()
        }

        dependencies {
            compile 'io.crate:crate-jdbc:VERSION'
            ...
        }

Connect to CrateDB

Connect to CrateDB Cluster with the Java DriverManager:

.. code-block:: java

    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection("crate://SERVER_IP:5432/");
