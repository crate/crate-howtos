- `Zesty Zapus`_ (17.04)
- `Yakkety Yak`_ (16.10)
- `Xenial Xerus`_ (16.04)

.. _Artful Aardvark: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArtfulAardvark/ReleaseNotes
.. _Zesty Zapus: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZestyZapus/ReleaseNotes
.. _Yakkety Yak: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/YakketyYak/ReleaseNotes
.. _Xenial Xerus: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XenialXerus/ReleaseNotes
.. _Trusty Tahr: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseNotes

.. CAUTION::

   CrateDB requires Java 8 or higher.

   To run CrateDB on Ubuntu releases older than Trusty Tahr 14.10, you will need
   to :ref:`install Java 8 from a 3rd party repository <debian-wheezy>`.

Configure Apt
=============

CrateDB 2.1.0 or Higher
-----------------------

.. NOTE::

   The official CrateDB repository only contains CrateDB 2.1.0 or higher.

   Consult the section for `Older Versions`_ if necessary.

Firstly, you will need to configure `Apt`_ (the Ubuntu package manager) to trust
the CrateDB repository.

.. _Apt: https://wiki.debian.org/Apt

Download the CrateDB GPG key:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

And then add the key to Apt:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

CrateDB provides a stable release and a testing release channel. At this point,
you should select which one you wish to use.

Create an Apt configuration file, like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/crate-CHANNEL.list

Here, replace ``CHANNEL`` with ``stable`` or ``testing``, depending on which
type of release channel you plan to use.

Then, edit it, and add the following:

.. code-block:: text

   deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/CHANNEL/ CODENAME main
   deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/CHANNEL/ CODENAME main

Here, replace ``CHANNEL`` as above, and then, additionally, replace
``CODENAME`` with the codename of your distribution, which can be round by
running:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ source /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME

You can now install CrateDB.

Skip to `Install CrateDB`_.

Older Versions
--------------

.. CAUTION::

   This method of installation has been deprecated and does not support CrateDB
   2.1.0 or higher.

For version of CrateDB older than 2.1.0, you will have to install from an
official, but unmaintained, `PPA repository`_.

.. _PPA repository: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas

Firstly, you will need to install package that allows you to add new PPA repositories:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties

If you're running Xenial Xerus (16.04) or higher, you will also need to
install this package:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

CrateDB provides a stable and a testing release channel. At this point, you
should select which one you wish to use.

Now, it will be possible to add the PPA repository, like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:crate/CHANNEL

Here, replace ``CHANNEL`` with ``stable`` or ``testing``, depending on which
release channel you plan to use.

You can now install CrateDB.

Install CrateDB
===============

With everything set up, you can install CrateDB, like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-get update
   sh$ sudo apt-get install crate

After the installation is finished, the ``crate`` service should be
up-and-running.

You should be able to access it by visiting::

  http://localhost:4200/

.. TIP::

   If you're new to CrateDB, check out our our `first use`_ documentation.

.. _first use: https://crate.io/docs/crate/getting-started/en/latest/first-use/index.html

Controlling CrateDB
===================

With Xenial Xerus (15.04) and above, you can control the ``crate`` service like
so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo systemctl COMMAND crate

With Trusty Tahr (14.04), you should use:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo service crate COMMAND

In both instances, replace ``COMMAND`` with ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``,
``status``, etc.

Configuration
=============

The CrateDB startup script `sources`_ environment variables from the
``/etc/default/crate`` file.

.. _sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(command)

You can use this mechanism to configure CrateDB.

Here's one example:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Heap Size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max)
   CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

   # Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
   # MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

   # Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
   # bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
   # CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
   MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

   # Additional Java OPTS
   # CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

   # Force the JVM to use IPv4 stack
   CRATE_USE_IPV4=true
