Run CrateDB on Debian GNU/Linux
===============================

CrateDB maintains packages for the follow Debian versions:

- `Stretch`_ (9.x)
- `Jessie`_ (8.x)
- `Wheezy`_ (7.x)

.. _Wheezy: https://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/
.. _Jessie: https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/
.. _Stretch: https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/

This document will walk you through the process of installing and configuring
the CrateDB Debian package.

.. NOTE::

   This document targets production deployments.

   If you're just getting started with CrateDB, we also provide a `one-step
   Linux installer`_ .

Configure Apt
=============

Firstly, you will need to upgrade `Apt`_ (the Debian package manager) with HTTPS
support, like so:

.. _Apt: https://wiki.debian.org/Apt

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

After that, you will need to download the CrateDB GPG key:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ wget https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

And then, so that Apt trusts the CrateDB repository, add the key:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-key add DEB-GPG-KEY-crate

CrateDB provides a stable and a testing release channel. At this point, you
should select which one you wish to use.

Create an Apt configuration file, like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo touch /etc/apt/sources.list.d/crate-CHANNEL.list

Here, replace ``CHANNEL`` with ``stable`` or ``testing``, depending on which
release channel you plan to use.

Then, edit it, and add the following:

.. code-block:: text

   deb https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/CHANNEL/ CODENAME main
   deb-src https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/apt/CHANNEL/ CODENAME main

Here, replace ``CHANNEL`` as above, and then, additionally, replace
``CODENAME`` with the codename of your distribution, which be ``wheezy``,
``jessie``, or ``stretch``.

Once that is done, update Apt:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-get update

You should see a success message. This indicates that the CrateDB release
channel is correctly configured and the ``crate`` package has been registered
locally.

Additional Steps
================

CrateDB requires Java 8 or higher.

To run CrateDB on Debian releases older than Debian Stretch, you will need to
follow some additional steps.

Debian Jessie (8.x)
-------------------

Debian Jessie provides Java 8 via the `backports`_ repository.

.. _backports: https://backports.debian.org/

You can set up the backports repository like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ REPO_URL="http://http.debian.net/debian"

   sh$ echo "deb $REPO_URL jessie-backports main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

.. _debian-wheezy:

Debian Wheezy (7.x)
-------------------

Debian Wheezy does not officially ship with Java 8, so you will have to install
it from a third party repository.

We recommend the `WebUpd8 team`_ repository, which you can configure like so:

.. _WebUpd8 team: https://launchpad.net/~webupd8team

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ REPO_URL="http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu"

   sh$ echo "deb $REPO_URL precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
   sh$ echo "deb-src $REPO_URL precise main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list

   sh$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EEA14886
   sh$ sudo apt-get update
   sh$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

Install CrateDB
===============

With everything set up, you can install CrateDB, like so:

.. code-block:: sh

   sh$ sudo apt-get install crate

After the installation is finished, the ``crate`` service should be
up-and-running.

You should be able to access it by visiting::

  http://localhost:4200/

.. SEEALSO::

   If you're new to CrateDB, check out our our `first use`_ documentation.

.. _first use: https://crate.io/docs/crate/getting-started/en/latest/first-use/index.html

Controlling CrateDB
===================

With Debian Jessie (8.x) and above, you can control the ``crate`` service like
so:

.. code-block:: sh

    sh$ sudo systemctl COMMAND crate

With Debian Wheezy (9.x), you must do this instead:

.. code-block:: sh

    sh$ sudo /etc/init.d/crate COMMAND

In both instances, replace ``COMMAND`` with ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``,
``status``, etc.

.. CAUTION::

    Be sure to read the guide to :ref:`rolling upgrades <rolling_upgrade>` and
    :ref:`full restart upgrades <full_restart_upgrade>` before attempting to
    upgrade a running cluster.

Configuration
=============

Configuration Files
-------------------

The main CrateDB configuration files are located in the ``/etc/crate``
directory.

Environment
-----------

The CrateDB startup script `sources`_ environment variables from the
``/etc/default/crate`` file.

.. _sources: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(command)

You can use this mechanism to configure CrateDB.

Here's one example:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Heap Size (defaults to 256m min, 1g max)
   CRATE_HEAP_SIZE=2g

   # Maximum number of open files, defaults to 65535.
   # MAX_OPEN_FILES=65535

   # Maximum locked memory size. Set to "unlimited" if you use the
   # bootstrap.mlockall option in crate.yml. You must also set
   # CRATE_HEAP_SIZE.
   MAX_LOCKED_MEMORY=unlimited

   # Additional Java OPTS
   # CRATE_JAVA_OPTS=

   # Force the JVM to use IPv4 stack
   CRATE_USE_IPV4=true

Customized Setups
=================

A full list of package files can be obtained with this command::

     sh$ dpkg-query -L crate

If you want to deviate from the way that the ``crate`` package integrates with
your system, we recommend that you go with a `basic tarball installation`_.
