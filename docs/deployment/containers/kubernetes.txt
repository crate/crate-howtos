Run CrateDB on Kubernetes
=========================

CrateDB and `Docker`_ are a great match thanks to CrateDBâ€™s `horizontally
scalable`_ `shared-nothing architecture`_ that lends itself well to
`containerization`_.

`Kubernetes`_ is an open-source container orchestration system for the
management, deployment, and scaling of containerized systems.

Together, Docker and Kubernetes are a fantastic way to deploy and scale CrateDB.

.. NOTE::

   While Kubernetes works with a variety of container technologies, this
   document only covers its use with Docker.

Prerequisites
=============

This document assumes `familiarity with Kubernetes`_.

Before continuing you should already have a Kubernetes cluster up-and-running
with at least one master node and one worker node.

.. SEEALSO::

   You can use `kubeadm`_ to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster by hand.

   Alternatively, cloud services such as `Azure Kubernetes Service`_ or the
   `Amazon Kubernetes Service`_ can do this for you.

Configuration
=============

This document provides an example `configuration`_ for Kubernetes that should
produce a three-node CrateDB cluster that is ready to use.

The example configuration includes:

- Two `services`_ (for internal and external communication)

- A `controller`_

- A `persistent volume`_

Services
--------

A Kubernetes pod is ephemeral and so is its network address. Typically, this
means that it is inadvisable to connect to pods directly.

A Kubernetes `service`_ allows you to define a network access policy for a set
of pods. You can then use the network address of the service to communicate
with the pods. The network address of the service remains static even though the
constituent pods may come and go.

For our purposes, we define two services: an `internal service`_ and an
`external service`_.

Internal Service
................

CrateDB uses the internal service for `node discovery via DNS`_ and
:ref:`inter-node communication <inter-node-comms>`.

Here's an example configuration snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: crate-internal-service
      labels:
        app: crate
    spec:
      # A static IP address is assigned to this service. This IP address is
      # only reachable from within the Kubernetes cluster.
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
        # Port 4300 for inter-node communication.
      - port: 4300
        name: crate-internal
      selector:
        # Apply this to all nodes with the `app:crate` label.
        app: crate

External Service
................

The external service provides a stable network address for external clients.

Here's an example configuration snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: crate-external-service
      labels:
        app: crate
    spec:
      # Create an externally reachable load balancer.
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
        # Port 4200 for HTTP clients.
      - port: 4200
        name: crate-web
        # Port 5432 for PostgreSQL wire protocol clients.
      - port: 5432
        name: postgres
      selector:
        # Apply this to all nodes with the `app:crate` label.
        app: crate

.. NOTE::

   In production, a `LoadBalancer`_ service type is typically only available on
   hosted cloud platforms that provide externally managed load balancers.
   However, an `ingress`_ resource can be used to provide internally managed
   load balancers.

   For local development, `Minikube`_ provides a LoadBalancer service.

Controller
----------

A Kubernetes `pod`_ is a group of one or more containers. Pods are designed to
provide discrete units of functionality.

CrateDB nodes are self-contained, so we don't need to use more than one
container in a pod. We can configure our pods as a single container running
CrateDB.

Pods are designed to be fungible computing units, meaning they can be created or
destroyed at will. This, in turn, means that:

- A cluster can be scaled in or out by destroying or creating pods

- A cluster can be healed by replacing pods

- A cluster can be rebalanced by rescheduling pods (i.e., destroying the pod on
  one Kubernetes node and recreating it on a new node)

However, CrateDB nodes that leave and then want to rejoin a cluster must retain
their state. That is, they must continue to use the same name and must continue
to use the same data on disk.

For this reason, we use the `StatefulSet`_ controller to define our cluster,
which ensures that CrateDB nodes retain state across restarts or rescheduling.

The following configuration snippet defines controller for a three-node
CrateDB cluster:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    # We're using a StatefulSet controller.
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
      # This is the name used as a prefix for all pods in the set.
      name: crate
    spec:
      serviceName: "crate-set"
      # Our cluster has three nodes.
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          # The pods in this cluster have the `app:crate` app label.
          app: crate
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: crate
        spec:
          # InitContainers run before the main containers of a pod are
          # started, and they must terminate before the primary containers
          # are initialized. Here, we use one to set the correct memory
          # map limit.
          initContainers:
          - name: init-sysctl
            image: busybox
            imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
            command: ["sysctl", "-w", "vm.max_map_count=262144"]
            securityContext:
              privileged: true
          # This final section is the core of the StatefulSet configuration.
          # It defines the container to run in each pod.
          containers:
          - name: crate
            # Use the CrateDB 3.0.5 Docker image.
            image: crate:3.0.5
            # Pass in configuration to CrateDB via command-line options.
            # Notice that we are configuring CrateDB unicast host discovery
            # using the SRV records provided by Kubernetes.
            command:
              - /docker-entrypoint.sh
              - -Ccluster.name=${CLUSTER_NAME}
              - -Cdiscovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes=2
              - -Cdiscovery.zen.hosts_provider=srv
              - -Cdiscovery.srv.query=_crate-internal._tcp.crate-internal-service.${NAMESPACE}.svc.cluster.local
              - -Cgateway.recover_after_nodes=2
              - -Cgateway.expected_nodes=${EXPECTED_NODES}
              - -Cpath.data=/data
            volumeMounts:
                  # Mount the `/data` directory as a volume named `data`.
                - mountPath: /data
                  name: data
            resources:
              limits:
                # How much memory each pod gets.
                memory: 512Mi
            ports:
              # Port 4300 for inter-node communication.
            - containerPort: 4300
              name: crate-internal
              # Port 4200 for HTTP clients.
            - containerPort: 4200
              name: crate-web
              # Port 5432 for PostgreSQL wire protocol clients.
            - containerPort: 5432
              name: postgres
            # Environment variables passed through to the container.
            env:
              # This is variable is detected by CrateDB.
            - name: CRATE_HEAP_SIZE
              value: "256m"
              # The rest of these variables are used in the command-line
              # options.
            - name: EXPECTED_NODES
              value: "3"
            - name: CLUSTER_NAME
              value: "my-crate"
            - name: NAMESPACE
              valueFrom:
                fieldRef:
                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        # Use persistent storage.
        - metadata:
            name: data
          spec:
            accessModes:
            - ReadWriteOnce
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 1Gi

.. SEEALSO::

   CrateDB supports `configuration via command-line options`_ and `node
   discovery via DNS`_.

   :ref:`Configure memory <memory>` by hand for optimum performance.

   You must set memory map limits correctly. Consult the :ref:`bootstrap checks
   <bootstrap_checks>` documentation for more information.

Persistent Volume
-----------------

As mentioned in the `Controller`_ section, CrateDB containers must be able to
retain state between restarts and rescheduling. This can be achieved using
`persistent volumes`_.

There are many different ways to provide persistent volumes, and so the specific
configuration will depend on your setup.

Microsoft Azure
...............

You can create a `StorageClass`_ for `Azure Managed Disks`_ with a
configuration snippet like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      # The name chosen here can be used to create volume claims.
      name: azure-premium-managed-disk
      labels:
        storage-tier: premium
        volume-type: ssd
        addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile
    provisioner: kubernetes.io/azure-disk
    parameters:
      kind: Managed
      storageaccounttype: Premium_LRS

You can then use this in your controller configuration with something like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

    [...]
      volumeClaimTemplates:
        - metadata:
            name: persistant-data
          spec:
            # This will create one 100GB read-write Azure Managed Disks volume
            # for every CrateDB pod.
            accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
            storageClassName: azure-premium-managed-disk
            resources:
              requests:
                storage: 100g
