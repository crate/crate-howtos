Outline how to determine a sweetspot:
Start with a single node
Create schema with a conservative number of shards
Run benchmark
Play around with concurrency settings
(show graph at this point)
Change number of shards settings
Show influence
Show how it changes with 2 nodes


Mention connection-reuse, connection pooling (https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP)
