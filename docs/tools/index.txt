There are several tools that play well with CrateDB, from development utilities
to data visualization tools. We even use some of them ourselves!

- **Pentaho**

  `Pentaho`_ prepares and blends data, delivering business analytics from any
  source. You can connect to CrateDB clusters by using `Petaho Kettle`_ and the
  standalone version of `our JDBC driver`.

- **StreamSets Data Collector**

  The `StreamSets`_ Data Collector is a lightweight, powerful engine that
  streams data in real time. `Read more`_.

- **Zoomdata**

  Zoomdata is a SaaS solution for deep analysis of big data sets in a visual
  interface. CrateDB is available as a data source connection.

- **Metabase**

  `Metabase`_ is an open source, easy-to-use visualization that answers questions
  about your data. It's written in Clojure and comes with a CrateDB driver out of
  the box! Read more about it in our `blog post`_.
