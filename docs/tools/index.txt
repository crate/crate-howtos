There are several tools that play well with CrateDB, from development utilities
to data visualization tools. We even use some of them ourselves!

This page gives an overview of the tools available and tested with the latest
version of CrateDB. If you know of any other tools that work well with CrateDB,
please `get in touch <mailto:office@crate.io>`_.
