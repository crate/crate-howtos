=============================
Using Crate with SQuirreL SQL
=============================

`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_ is a graphical SQL client application
that can be used to browse and query a JDBC compliant database.

As Crate supports JDBC with its Crate JDBC driver, it can easily be used with
SQUirreL.

Setup
-----

`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_ does not provide a Crate driver with
its distribution, so an extra setup step is required to run Crate with
`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_:

1. Copy the `Crate JDBC standalone
   <https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view/files/io/crate/crate-jdbc-standalone>`_
   jar to the SQuirreL lib folder. On OS X, when installing SQuirreL with the
   MaxOS X installer, this is
   ``/Applications/SQuirreLSQL.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/``

2. Start `SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_.

3. Choose the ``Drivers`` tab and add a new driver, adding the following
   information into the form and confirm by pressing ok.

4. Choose the ``Aliases`` tab and add a new Alias, Choose your new driver
   (called crate in our example) and enter your database URL. Username and
   password are not supported, so leave them blank.

5. Connect your alias to your crate instance.

Usage
-----

You can browse Crate using the Object Tree Worksheet, that is the usual view
you use for browsing your tables and get information about their schema.
