Using CrateDB with SQuirreL SQL
===============================

`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_ is a graphical SQL client application
that can be used to browse and query a JDBC compliant database.

As CrateDB supports JDBC with its CrateDB JDBC driver, it can easily be used
with SQUirreL.

Setup
=====

`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_ does not provide a CrateDB driver
with its distribution, so an extra setup step is required to run CrateDB with
`SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_:

1. Copy the `CrateDB JDBC standalone
   <https://bintray.com/crate/crate/crate-jdbc/view/files/io/crate/crate-jdbc-standalone>`_
   jar to the SQuirreL lib folder. On OS X, when installing SQuirreL with the
   MaxOS X installer, this is
   ``/Applications/SQuirreLSQL.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib/``

2. Start `SQuirreL <http://www.squirrelsql.org/>`_.

3. Choose the ``Drivers`` tab and add a new driver, adding the following
   information into the form and confirm by pressing ok.

4. Choose the ``Aliases`` tab and add a new Alias, Choose your new driver
   (called ``CrateDB`` in our example) and enter your database URL. By default,
   we authenticate as the ``crate`` user with no password..
